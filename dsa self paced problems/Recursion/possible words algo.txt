String[] str = {"abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"};
buffer[]={0,0,0};
a[]={2,3,4}
 buffer length is equal with the length of a
 each and every element of buffer can have values from 0 to max(buffer[bindex])=str[a[bindex]-2].length-1
 the traversing will come to an if all the elements in the buffer array reach to its maximum value all togrether
 th evalues of the buffer[] elements should increase in binary value increamental manner
 and when bindex==buffer.length at that tym we need to print 'st'

  reach till the end buffer appending st.setCharAt(bindex,str[a[bindex]-2].charAt(buffer[bindex])) and checking if any bit has reached to it's maxval
 bindex++

 if(bindex==buffer.length) // it's time to print
 {
     sop(st);
 }

 checkAllBit(buffer)
